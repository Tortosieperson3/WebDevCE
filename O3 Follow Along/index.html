            What it says
        </h2>
        <p>
             “We hold these truths to be <strong>self-evident</strong>, that all men are <em>created equal</em>, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of happiness.”

            Why we are upset
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
            </li>
            <li>
                He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
            </li>
        </ol>
